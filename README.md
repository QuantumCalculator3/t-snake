# t-snake
A simple text based snake game to be played in the terminal.
WASD to play.

# Installation
To install, download the t-snake.c file from the latest release and compile it with gcc. Place it in /usr/local/bin for global use. Tested for compatibility with MacOS.
It might work on other UNIX systems, but I haven't tested it.
